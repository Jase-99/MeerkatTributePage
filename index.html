                    The meerkat (Suricata suricatta) or suricate is a small mongoose found in southern Africa.
                </div>
                <div class="info-item">
                    Characterised by a broad head, large eyes, a pointed snout, long legs, a thin tapering tail, and a
                    brindled coat pattern.
                </div>
                <div class="info-item">
                    Meerkats are eusocial, and form packs of two to 30 individuals each that occupy home ranges around 5
                    km2
                </div>
                <div class="info-item">
                    Members of a pack take turns at jobs such as looking after pups and keeping a lookout for predators.
                </div>
                <div class="info-item">
                    Packs live in rock crevices in stony areas and in large burrow systems in plains.
                </div>
                <div class="info-item">
                    Encounters between members of different packs are highly aggressive, leading to severe injuries and
                    sometimes deaths.
                </div>
                <div class="info-item">
                    Meerkat burrows are typically 5 m (16 ft) in diameter with around 15 openings.
                </div>
                <div class="info-item">
                    Meerkats are generally tame animals. However, they are unsuitable as a pet as they can be aggressive
                    and have a strong, ferret-like odour.
                </div>
                <div class="info-item">
                    Meerkats spend nearly five to eight hours foraging every day. Like other social mongooses, meerkats
                    in a pack will disperse within 5m.
                </div>
                <div class="info-item">
                    The meerkat has a specialised thermoregulation system that helps it survive in its harsh desert
                    habitat.
                </div>
                <div class="info-item">
                    Meerkats are widely depicted in television, movies and other media.
                </div>
                <div class="info-item">
                    They use a broad variety of calls to communicate among one another for different purposes, for
                    example to raise alarm on sighting a predator.
